# Project Name: Cafeteria in Pocket

# Academic project of Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology
## Department of Computer Science & Engineering
## Course No : CSE2200
## Course Title : Software Development â€“ III

## Date of Submission : 20.05.2018

## Description: 
We always have a very tight schedule in our busy varsity life. For example we do
not have any time gaps between our classes or labs. So we do not get time to have our snacks
or breakfast in between classes. Even if we manage to spare a few minutes between our
classes, we have to face a long queue in the cafeteria as it is always over crowded. At that time
either we can have our food or we have to miss our important class lecture. Our app will help to
overcome this kind of situation. By the help of our app a student can order their food while
doing his classes. He can also know whether desired food items are available or not. And he can
also keep accounts of his pocket money. And he will not miss any of his important lectures nor
will he be in a rush to have his food.
